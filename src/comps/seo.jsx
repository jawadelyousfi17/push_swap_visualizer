    <h2>Push Swap Visualizer – A Powerful Tool for Understanding Sorting Algorithms</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Push Swap Visualizer</strong> is an interactive tool designed to help developers, students, and coding enthusiasts visualize the <strong>Push Swap sorting algorithm</strong> used in C programming. This tool provides a step-by-step animation of how numbers are sorted using <strong>two stacks (A and B)</strong> and a set of predefined operations.</p>

    <h3>🚀 Key Features of the Push Swap Visualizer:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step-by-Step Execution:</strong> Watch the sorting process unfold in real time.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Controls:</strong> Pause, rewind, or speed up the sorting visualization.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Input Support:</strong> Enter your own numbers to see how the algorithm handles different cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimized for Learning:</strong> Ideal for students preparing for <strong>42 School’s push_swap project</strong> or anyone interested in algorithmic problem-solving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🧑‍💻 Why Use a Push Swap Visualizer?</h3>
    <p>Understanding the <strong>Push Swap algorithm</strong> can be challenging without visual representation. By using a visualizer, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ Grasp the logic behind <strong>push (pb, pa)</strong> and <strong>swap (sa, sb, ss)</strong> operations.</li>
        <li>✅ Identify inefficiencies in your sorting implementation.</li>
        <li>✅ Improve debugging and optimize the number of moves required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔥 Perfect for Coding Challenges & 42 School Projects</h3>
    <p>If you're working on the <strong>push_swap project</strong> at <strong>42 School</strong>, this tool is a must-have. It helps you develop an efficient algorithm while <strong>minimizing the number of moves</strong>—a key factor in achieving a high score.</p>
